# JavaScript and classes.

Yes, JavaScript has classes, but they are not like classes in traditional object-oriented programming (OOP) languages such as Java or C#. JavaScript classes are a syntactical sugar over its prototype-based inheritance model, introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6). While they look and behave similarly to classes in other OOP languages, they are still built on top of JavaScript's existing prototype-based inheritance system.

## OOP

## Object
-collection of properties(variables,const) and methods(function)

-toLowerCase.

## Why use OOP

## parts of OOP
Object literal

- Constructor function 
- Prototypes
- Classes
- Instances(new,this)

## 4 pillars 
Abstraction(hiding the details like fetch)

Encapsulation (Encapsulation is the practice of bundling data and methods into a single unit, like a class, while hiding internal details and providing controlled access through public methods, ensuring data security and simplicity)

Inheritance

Polymorphism(one method do many works)
